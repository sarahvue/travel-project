            <h2>Why Anaheim</h2>
            <h3>Anaheim, the Heart of the SoCal</h3>
            <p>
              Anaheim, located in Southern California, is best known as the home
              of Disneyland Resort, attracting millions of visitors each year to
              its theme parks and entertainment district. This vibrant city,
              founded in 1857 by German immigrants, has grown into a major hub
              for tourism and culture, offering a variety of dining, shopping,
              and recreational activities. Anaheim's mild climate and sunny
              weather make it an ideal destination for outdoor events and
              activities throughout the year.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond its tourist attractions, Anaheim boasts a rich history and
              a diverse community. The city is also home to the Anaheim Ducks, a
              professional hockey team, and the Los Angeles Angels, a Major
              League Baseball team, which adds to its reputation as a sports
              destination. With its blend of history, entertainment, and
              community spirit, Anaheim offers something for everyone, from
              families seeking fun to residents enjoying a high quality of life.
